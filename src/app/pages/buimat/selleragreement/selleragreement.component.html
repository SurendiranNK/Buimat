                        <li>Invoice generation: A seller expressly agrees that issuing correct and complete invoice is the sole and primary responsibility of a seller. We will assist you with this process by generating an invoice on your behalf.&nbsp; For us to generate these invoices, we would need a digital image of your signature which will be affixed on the invoice. The invoice shall then be generated and sent to the seller. The seller shall be required to physically sign the invoice, print the invoice and affix the same on the consignment. The invoice generated by Buimat shall be affixed by the seller on the consignment. Notwithstanding anything else contained in these terms of use, the seller shall be solely liable for any liability which may be imposed by taxation authorities for any discrepancy in the invoices.&nbsp;</li>

In case the chargeback is ruled against a seller, Buimat shall be entitled and authorized to recover the same from the seller to its fullest extent and the bank&rsquo;s decision shall be final and binding in this regard. In the event Buimat has made any excess payment to the seller inadvertently, such excess payments shall be set-off from any future payments payable by Buimat to the seller.</li>
                        <li>Buimat may delay notifying the payment confirmation, i.e. informing the seller to dispatch if Buimat deems suspicious or a buyer conducts high transaction volumes to ensure safety of the transaction and transaction price. In addition, Buimat may hold transaction prices and not inform sellers to dispatch or remit transaction prices to law enforcement officials (instead of refunding the same to a buyer) at the request of law enforcement officials or in the event of a buyer being engaged in any form of illegal activity.</li>
                        <li>Sellers acknowledge that Buimat will not be liable for any damages, interests, claims etc. resulting from not processing a transaction/transaction price or any delay in processing a transaction/transaction price that is beyond the control of Buimat.</li>
